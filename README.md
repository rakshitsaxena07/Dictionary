                                    Dictionary Using Python:


This Python application allows users to look up words and get their meanings. It employs a JSON file, dictionary.json, to store the word-meaning pairs. Additionally, it incorporates a feature to suggest the correct word if there's a slight misspelling, enhancing the user experience.

--->AI_Concepts Used:
1.Fuzzy Matching: The use of the get_close_matches function from the difflib module allows your dictionary to suggest words even if there's a slight misspelling. This functionality mimics some aspects of natural language processing (NLP), a field closely related to AI.

2.User Interaction: The use of a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter allows users to interact with the dictionary more intuitively. While Tkinter itself is not AI, the way it enables human-computer interaction can be seen as a form of AI, specifically in the realm of human-computer interaction (HCI).

3.Decision Making: The application prompts the user with a messagebox to confirm if a suggested word is correct. This decision-making process is a basic form of interaction and can be considered a rudimentary aspect of AI.

--->Features:
Word Lookup: Users can type in a word, and the application will display its meaning.
Correction Suggestion: If a word is misspelled or not found in the dictionary, the application suggests the closest match.
Probability Correctness Level: The application provides a probability correctness level for the suggested word, helping users assess its accuracy.

--->Files:
dictionary.py: The main Python script containing the application logic.
dictionary.json: A JSON file storing word-meaning pairs. The application uses this file as the dictionary.
README.md: The readme file providing information about the project.

--->Usage:
Run the dictionary.py script.
Type a word in the input field.
Press Enter or click the search button to display the meaning.
If the word is misspelled or not found, the application suggests the closest match. Users can choose to accept the suggestion or enter a different word.

--->Dependencies:
This project requires Python 3.x. No additional external libraries are needed as it utilizes standard Python modules like json.
